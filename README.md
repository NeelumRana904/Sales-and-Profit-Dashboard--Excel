# Sales-and-Profit-Dashboard--Excel
# Project Overview
This project demonstrates a comprehensive Sales and Profit Dashboard created using Microsoft Excel. It showcases end-to-end data analysis, from data preparation and cleaning to insightful visualizations. Designed for performance monitoring and strategic business insights, the dashboard allows users to interactively explore metrics such as total sales, profit trends, top customers, and regional performance.
The project reflects key concepts from Advanced Excel for Data Analytics, utilizing Excel’s powerful analytical tools including PivotTables, PivotCharts, Slicers, and custom charting techniques.
